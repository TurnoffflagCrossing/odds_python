Python parser for football odds

This script was a try for making possible sure bet.
I was trying to parse http://www.oddscheck.net/?page=home&cmd=def html code for finding best odds for 1X2.
After finding best odds for every match i was calculating ganniota and finnaly i was printing sure bet matches.
